This tool is a Node.js application that utilizes Puppeteer/Chromium to retrieve job ads from seek.com.au and convert them into structured data in JSON format. 

The application also uses AI tools to transform job ads into structured data and automatically evaluate if the job fits my background. 

The evaluation result is presented as a score from 1 to 5. Once the data is parsed, it is imported into MongoDB. 

Another web app, written in Express/Vue.js, displays the data in a web UI with filtering functionality.
